    <p>Welcome to Code Arsenal, an open-source project dedicated to enhancing software security through collaborative efforts. Our mission is to provide a centralized platform where security professionals from different countries and companies can contribute their expertise and knowledge to address known security vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p>At Code Arsenal, we believe that by sharing detailed fixes for security vulnerabilities in various programming languages and discussing different approaches, we can empower programmers to better understand the mindset of hackers and security engineers. Through this understanding, they can effectively work on fixing critical security bugs and preventing them in the future.</p>
    <p>We request all security professionals to contribute to this project by providing articles and write-ups. You can choose any security issue and programming language to start writing about how others can fix it. Please include information on necessary code changes, network-level monitoring, and any additional supporting tips, such as WAF rule recommendations. For more information, please contact the lead maintainer of this project.</p>
